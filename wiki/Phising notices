## Phising notices

When you use the API and the IP of the account you are managing and the user mismatch, it will appear a phising notice. This is a security measure offered by Instagram to avoid the accounts being hijacked by tracking usual IPs, if the user started using a new IP from a different location, it will trigger this scenario. 

### Causes

- IP mismatch or different location
- IP used is from a server, not from a domestic or mobile connection IP
- IP/Subnet banned

### Solution

- Changing password
- Going through the checkpoint verification to validate the IP
